      <description>I am a passionate and experienced postgraduate researcher at the University of Glasgowâ€™s School of Psychology and Neuroscience. I work with Prof Monika Harvey, Prof Gregor Thut and Dr Gemma Learmonth.
My main topic of interest is motivation and changes in attention and their role in the experience of fatigue. I contributed to research on the role of alerting mechanisms in ageing and stroke rehabilitation using electroencephalography (EEG) as well as development of clinical behavioural testing using online experimentation.</description>

      <description>Current Research: How does a psychological experiment work? Disentangling the individual components of our mind that make our performance. I am currently running an experiment integrating insight into attention, cognition, volition and all the processes that govern our behavioural. If you are interested in taking part, contact me!

      <description>Coding I have multiple years of experience accessing data, including data from databases using MySQL and SQLite as well as restructuring and cleaning data using Numpy, Pandas and Scipy in Python and the amazing Tidyverse in R, often as part of larger projects organised through Jupyter notebooks or R Packages.
In the following code, I use a combination of base R and Tidyverse functional programming to make a useful fuction to carry out an operation that often occurs in wrangling.</description>
