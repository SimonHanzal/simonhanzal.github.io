      <description>I am a passionate and experienced postgraduate researcher at the University of Glasgowâ€™s School of Psychology and Neuroscience. I work with Prof Monika Harvey, Prof Gregor Thut and Dr Gemma Learmonth.
My main topic of interest is attention and its role in various neurological disorders. I contributed to research on the role of phasic alerting in ageing and stroke rehabilitation using electroencephalography (EEG) as well as development of clinical behavioural testing using online experimentation.</description>

      <description>Current Research: Investigating the suitability of neurofeedback to improve fatigue I am currently working on a neurofeedback intervention test in healthy adult population which will improve fatigue using EEG neurofeedback.

      <description>Coding I have multiple years of experience accessing data, including data from databases using MySQL and SQLite as well as restructuring and cleaning data using Numpy, Pandas and Scipy in Python and the amazing Tidyverse in R, often as part of larger projects organised through Jupyter notebooks or R Packages.
In the following code, I use a combination of base R and Tidyverse functional programming to make a useful fuction to carry out an operation that often occurs in wrangling.</description>
