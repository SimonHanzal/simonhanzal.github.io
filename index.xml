      <description>I am a passionate and experienced postgraduate researcher at the University of Glasgow’s School of Psychology and Neuroscience. I work with Prof Monika Harvey, Prof Gregor Thut and Dr Gemma Learmonth.
My main topic of interest is attention and its role in various neurological disorders. I contributed to research on the role of phasic alerting in ageing and stroke rehabilitation using electroencephalography (EEG) as well as development of clinical behavioural testing using online experimentation.</description>

      <description>Current Research: Investigating the suitability of neurofeedback to improve fatigue I am currently working on a neurofeedback intervention test in healthy adult population which will improve fatigue using EEG neurofeedback.

      <description>Coding I have multiple years of experience accessing data, including data from databases using MySQL and SQLite as well as restructuring and cleaning data using Numpy, Pandas and Scipy in Python and the amazing Tidyverse in R, often as part of larger projects organised through Jupyter notebooks or R Packages.
In the following code, I use a combination of base R and Tidyverse functions to obtain indeces of trials since participant commission error (post-error slowing) and then programme and apply a custom summary function.</description>

      <description>„But it is clear that ethics has nothing to do with punishment and reward in the ordinary sense. This question as to the consequences of an action must therefore be irrelevant. At least these consequences will not be events. For there must be something right in that formulation of the question. There must be some sort of ethical reward and ethical punishment, but this must lie in the action itself. Of the will as the subject of the ethical we cannot speak.</description>

      <description>I present to you the findings which show that we can recognise objects both as literal things and symbols, whereas animals treat all objects in the world literally. It is evidence based on empirical observation of the world and which is thus factual for believers and non-believers alike. It is an outcome of an impressive work of science spanning several continents and nearly a thousand of humans and animals, published this April in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of France, doi.</description>

      <title>The forced loneliness of coronavirus lockdowns (from the GIST)</title>

      <description>What is forced loneliness? Abandonment is nasty and that’s why isolation makes for a terrific horror plot. Few tropes drive fearsome suspense more than extended isolation in a log cabin situated in the mountains or being trapped on a spaceship. The isolated characters in The Shining, The Thing and at the end of the classic The Blair Witch Project are pretty much in psychological pain even before physical pain arrives.</description>
