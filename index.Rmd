## Hello, welcome to my website!

I am a postgraduate research student at the University of Glasgow's <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/" title = "Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology"> Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology</a>. I work with <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/monikaharvey/" title = "Dr Monika Harvey">Dr Monika Harvey</a>,<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/staff/gregorthut/" title = "Prof Gregor Thut"> Prof Gregor Thut </a> and <a href="https://gemmalearmonth.com/" title = "Dr Gemma Learmonth">Dr Gemma Learmonth</a>.

My main topic of interest is attention and its role in various neurological disorders. I contributed to research on the role of phasic alerting in ageing and stroke rehabilitation using electroencephalography (EEG) as well as development of clinical behavioural testing using online experimentation. Previously, I also studied emotion and music-evoked autobiographical memories through public engagement. Insights from the project provided an improvement to the guidelines in therapeutic interventions for patients with a range of neurocognitive disorders. I am currently interested in the use of non-invasive EEG in neurofeedback therapy to relieve post-stroke fatigue and improve attention in stroke patients.
